# Dortania Updates

A new month for us with many of changes and improvements over at Acidanthera. With Dortania, we've added a fair number of improvements to our guides including documentation on OpenCore's password system!

Looking over to future changes in Dortania, we'd like to notify users of a potentially [large scale issue of `XhciPortLimit` in macOS 11.3 Beta 2(20E5186d) and newer](https://github.com/acidanthera/bugtracker/issues/1514). The specific issue regards users who have this quirk enabled and have not mapped their USB ports, as macOS 11.3 will now boot-loop for many users on installs, updates as well as regular OS boots. We've already prepped a [PR](https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Install-Guide/pull/238/files) to help warn users as well as provide work-arounds to this situation like hosting recovery images.

* Note: Users who have `XhciPortLimit` disabled need not worry, however please ensure you've [mapped your USB ports](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/usb/) before updating

Currently we expect 11.3 to be released to the public sometime this week or the coming weeks, so when these changes hit the public we will be merging the changes. Additionally, whenever there are new reports of `XhciPortLimit` being fixed, we will be updating the guide to ensure users know.
